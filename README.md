## üö® The Challenge in Privacy

Modern sharing workflows (screenshots of chats/dashboards, audios, captions, prompts sent to LLMs) routinely leak:
- Bystander faces and creator identity linkages
- Emails, phone numbers, IDs, addresses, credentials
- Internal project names, partial tokens, API keys (in screenshots / prompts)
- Street & shop signage, license plates (location inference)
- Screen overlays (notifications, chat bubbles) captured unintentionally

Manual blurring is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone; cloud redaction services introduce a *second* exposure surface (logging, retention, model retraining). Sentinel brings a multilayer privacy firewall directly onto your device.

Sentinel is your pre‚Äëpublish privacy shield: before you share a screenshot, send a prompt to an external AI, export a support log, or package a research dataset, it quietly sweeps your content for the usual suspects (faces, emails, phone numbers, IDs, screen text, signage, chat bubbles) and less obvious contextual clues (location hints, internal labels), then lets you instantly anonymize them with the style you prefer‚Äîfast automatic cleanup for quick sharing, or a deeper semantic pass when you need thorough assurance. Whether you‚Äôre a creator protecting bystanders, a team scrubbing screenshots, a researcher curating compliant datasets, or a developer sanitizing prompts, Sentinel turns privacy from a tedious afterthought into a smooth, on‚Äëdevice, one‚Äëclick habit‚Äîno cloud, no waiting, no second exposure risk.

## üì¶ Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download Required Models
Download the PII detection models from: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fxljdNcruwfbLTIBIjWU-dLWR2z-Gn3U?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fxljdNcruwfbLTIBIjWU-dLWR2z-Gn3U?usp=sharing)

Available models:
- `pii_ettin_encoder_1b_v1` - Ettin 1B encoder model (recommended)
- `pii_ettin_encoder_400m_v1` - Ettin 400M encoder model
- `pii_deberta_base_v1` - DeBERTa-based PII detection model
- `pii_modernbert_base_v1` - ModernBERT-based PII detection model

Download the Qwen2.5vl-3B model from: [https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct)

### 3. Set Up Yolo

MacOS
```bash
curl -L -o yolov12l-face.pt "https://github.com/YapaLab/yolo-face/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov12l-face.pt"

mkdir -p ~/.insightface/models

# Download InSwapper model
gdown "https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1krOLgjW2tAPaqV-Bw4YALz0xT5zlb5HF" \
  -O ~/.insightface/models/inswapper_128.onnx
```

Windows:
```bash
Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/YapaLab/yolo-face/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov12l-face.pt" -OutFile "yolov12l-face.pt"

mkdir .insightface\models

gdown "https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1krOLgjW2tAPaqV-Bw4YALz0xT5zlb5HF" `
  -O ".insightface\models\inswapper_128.onnx"
```

## üöÄ Run & Test

Test media (multi-face images, signage, screen snippets) live with following commands:

### macOS / Linux
```bash
python3 launcher.py
```

### Windows
```powershell
python launcher.py
```

Try inside the GUI:
- Switch Fast ‚Üî Deep Mode
- Toggle anonymization styles (Blur / Pixelate / Emoji / Synthetic)
- Keep largest face (retain creator identity)
- Interactive face selection (click faces to include/exclude)
- Load signage / screen / chat images to see text region fusion

### Deep Mode
Enabled directly in the GUI (no extra command). Use signage / chat / dashboard images to showcase semantic sweep now!

## üí† Core Features & Advantages

### Core Features
1. 100% On‚ÄëDevice Processing  
   All detection & anonymization run locally‚Äîno uploads, no server round‚Äëtrips.

2. Dual Modes (Fast / Deep)  
   Fast Mode: instant face + obvious region cleanup.  
   Deep Mode: adds OCR + contextual + semantic PII sweep for maximum coverage.

3. Multimodal Coverage (Now)  
   Faces, textual PII (58+ classes), screen / signage / chat and audio.

4. Visual Anonymization Styles  
   Blur (Gaussian/Box/Median), Pixelate, Emoji overlay, High‚Äëfidelity Synthetic Face Swap (InSwapper).

5. Text Privacy Engine  
   Structured entity tagging.

6. Bystander & Creator Controls  
   Keep largest face (retain presenter) or anonymize everyone; interactive include/exclude selection.

### Key Advantages
- Zero Secondary Exposure: Eliminates cloud logging & retention risks.
- Semantic Depth: Goes beyond plain OCR‚Äîcatches contextual & implicit sensitive cues.
- Fast-to-Use: GUI + one-click mode switching encourages habitual pre‚Äëpublish scrubbing.
- Aesthetic Flexibility: Choose the anonymization style that matches your brand or compliance needs.
- Compliance Ready: Deterministic policies + audit manifest support internal review & documentation.
